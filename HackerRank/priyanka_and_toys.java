// Problem: Priyanka and Toys
// Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/priyanka-and-toys
//
// Approach:
// 1. Priyanka buys toys in groups where each toy's weight is within 4 units
//    of the minimum weight in that group.
// 2. Sort the toy weights.
// 3. Start with the first toy's weight as the base (minWeight).
// 4. For each toy:
//      - If its weight â‰¤ minWeight + 4, it belongs to the current group.
//      - Otherwise, start a new group with this toy as new base.
// 5. Count the number of groups = number of containers needed.
// Time Complexity: O(n log n) (due to sorting)
// Space Complexity: O(1)
